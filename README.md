## Open a Github repository

To open a Github repository you have to enter the url directly in the browser. You just have to add "/{owner}/{repository}"  to the url.

## Write code

All your actions will be automatically committed to your repository.

You must absolutely have a `main.js` file at the root of your repository so that your code can be executed after submission.

A window will open. In this window you can see a button "Submit code" which allows you to submit your code for execution at any time.
