## Start playing

### You have never played before

To start playing, go to the PolyConquest extension located in the left navigation bar.

Then, choose the game you want to play among the proposed games, and click on Clone. You will be redirected to your first game directory.

You will have to repeat this action each time you want to play a new game.

### You have already played

Go to the PolyConquest extension, in the folders tab, you will find all the games you have already played.

You just have to choose the game you want to start.

## How to play ?

Read the rules of the game you have chosen in the `README.md` file in your game directory.

Perform the different actions you want in the `main.js` file, then send your code using the button on the game panel.

Once the code is sent, the result of your code is displayed in the game panel. 

## TIPS

You must have a `main.js` file in the root of your directory for your code to be executed after uploading.

You can access your game directly via the link `/{ID-Github}/PolyConquest_{game}`
